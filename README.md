## P Cygni

Over the past 400 years, the Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) star P Cygni (also known as 34 Cygni) has been heavily studied in a variety of ways. It was discovered in the year 1600 after suddenly brightening to 3$^{rd}$ magnitude. After this first recorded nova, P Cygni fluctuated irregularly between 3$^{rd}$ and 6$^{th}$ magnitude until about 1715 when it reached about 5.2 magnitude. Since then it has been in a period of quiescence, having only slowly increased in brightness to about 4.8 magnitude. In 1897 the first spectra of P Cygni were obtained, revealing the famous spectral line profile for which the star is best known. This profile, known as a P Cygni profile, is characterized by strong emission lines paired with blue-shifted absorption lines. This profile is caused by an expanding stellar envelope or by strong stellar winds.

The purpose of this repository is to investigate spectropolarimetric observations of P Cygni in order to better understand P Cygni as well as other massive stars and LBVs.
