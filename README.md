#P Cygni Polarization

## P Cygni

P Cygni (P Cyg) is a luminous blue variable (lbv) star, a type of hot, massive star
which is believed to go through intermittent, dramatic mass loss events. This mass
loss process, and the stellar material ejected can be studied through polarimetric
measurements. The purpose of this repository is to study spectropolarimetric data
of P Cyg and provide some tools for studying polarimetric data in general.
