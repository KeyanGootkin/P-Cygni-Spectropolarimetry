To do 2/23/2018

8) look for signals in ccd flux stuff near e/a lines, H-alpha
9)a) stack with a verticle shift.

9) median all of the above ccd

10) look at astropy false alarm probability
  -~4% and ~10%
  -needs to use the LombScargle object, so finding the false alarm doesn't take into account the nice hybrid periodogram.

11) plot phase-folded model of pos angle periodogram.

fix errors when binning
  Not sure how to make my functions callable?
  did it!? (??????), didn't make a callable function, my solution is really ugly like, but I did it.

find all interesting emission/absorption features with pol and pos.
Make them into nice pretty figures that can be shown side by side
  -The only significant looking ones are 5875 and h alpha, however, they are both still significant after fixing errors! :-)
  -ret file's errors are too big to see any


numpy digitize - gives bin edges


Do mean instead of median, see if features persist.
  - yes it is still there

subtract mean from individual observations. (QU space?) q - mean(q, axis = 0)

look at Q, U for the H-alpha features
q and u vs. wavelength, q vs u connect by wavelength (u on y), one per observation and average and median.
only around halpha, 50 on each side.

  -On median Q and U vs wavelength U has the weird shape, and has a higher magnitude, but Q does not.
  -Made all the individual Q and U vs. wavelength graphs, plus gif! its hard to pick out any pattern over time.
  -The Q vs. U graphs look like most of them might be making roughly straight lines? Now in gif form!
  -Both mean and median show this pattern as well.

figure out how things are changing with time.
